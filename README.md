## CHAPTER 1

## Introduction
In this project, we investigate the integration of an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) in a hybrid buck converter system. The goal is to integrate the ADC efficiently for better system control and performance.

## Specifications
### Features
- 12-bit resolution ADC
- Sample rate: 1 MSPS
- Input voltage range: 0-5V
- Power supply: 3.3V

### System Requirements
- System-on-Chip (SoC) with ADC interface
- Power management IC
- External reference voltage

## Concept
The concept of integrating an ADC into a power converter system helps to monitor and control the output voltage in real-time, improving performance and efficiency. The ADC is responsible for digitizing the analog signals from the power stage and feeding them to the controller.
